= What is a AIO Media Library Manager? 
All In One Media Library Manager is a WordPress plugin that helps you organize your media files (images, videos, documents etc.) within the WordPress media library. It essentially lets you create folders to categorize your media, making it much easier to find what you need.

= How it is useful? =

AIO Media Library Manager tackles the chaos of the default WordPress media library by letting you create folders. Here's how it streamlines your workflow:

**Use Cases:**

* **Bloggers:**  Imagine a folder for each blog post where you store all the images and documents related to that specific post. No more hunting through hundreds of random files!
* **Photographers:**  Create folders based on shoot themes (weddings, portraits, landscapes) and subfolders by date or client. Find any photo in seconds! 
* **Ecommerce Sites:**  Organize product images by category (clothing, electronics etc.) and even sub-categorize by brand. Effortlessly swap product images without confusion.

**Real-time Examples:**

1. **Uploading Photos for a New Blog Post:** With AIO, you can directly upload photos to a dedicated folder named "New Blog Post" within the media library. No need to sort them later.
2. **Managing Client Photos:** As a photographer, create a folder for "Client John Smith" with subfolders for "Engagement Shoot" and "Family Portraits." Quickly access all photos for the client.
3. **Adding Product Images on an Ecommerce Site:**  Create a folder named "Products" with subfolders for "T-Shirts," "Jeans," and "Shoes." Within "T-Shirts," you can have subfolders by brand. Easy to update product images and maintain a clean website.

**Bonus Tip:** AIO integrates with popular page builders, so you can browse and manage your media folders directly within the page builder interface, saving you time and frustration.
